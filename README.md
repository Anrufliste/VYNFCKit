# VYNFCKit

VYNFCKit is an iOS library used to parse Near Field Communication (NFC) NDEF message payload.

NDEF (NFC Data Exchange Format) is a standardized data format specification by the NFC Forum which is used to describe how a set of actions are to be encoded onto a NFC tag or to be exchanged between two active NFC devices. The vast majority of NFC enabled devices (readers, phones, tabletsâ€¦) support reading NDEF messages from NFC tags. On iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 plus with iOS 11, the third-party apps can read NFC tags. _Using Core NFC, you can read Near Field Communication (NFC) tags of types 1 through 5 that contain data in the NFC Data Exchange Format (NDEF)._ An NDEF message consists of header and payload. Core NFC parses message header, but does not parse message payload. This library **VYNFCKit** parses NFC NDEF message payload for you. It supports Objective-c and Swift.

## Supported payload types

Currently VYNFCKit supports the following  Well Known Type which is most widely used:

1. Text with UTF-8 or UTF-16 encoding, e.g. Hello World.
1. Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) with 36 schemes, such as http://, https://,  tel:, mailto:, ftp://, file://,  e.g. https://example.com, tel:5551236666
1. Smart poster. Smart poster is a special kind of NDEF Message, it is a wrapper for other message types. VYNFCKit supports

## Not yet supported payload type

1. Any types other than Well Known Type.

## How to use

Install with cocoapods.

```
#import <VYNFCKit/VYNFCKit.h>

- (void)readerSession:(nonnull NFCNDEFReaderSession *)session didDetectNDEFs:(nonnull NSArray<NFCNDEFMessage *> *)messages {
    for (NFCNDEFMessage *message in messages) {
        for (NFCNDEFPayload *payload in message.records) {
            id parsedPayload = [VYNFCNDEFPayloadParser parse:payload];
            if (parsedPayload) {
                NSString *text = @"";
                if ([parsedPayload isKindOfClass:[VYNFCNDEFTextPayload class]]) {
                    text = ((VYNFCNDEFTextPayload *)parsedPayload).text;
                } else if ([parsedPayload isKindOfClass:[VYNFCNDEFURIPayload class]]) {
                    text = ((VYNFCNDEFURIPayload *)parsedPayload).URIString;
                } else if ([parsedPayload isKindOfClass:[VYNFCNDEFTextXVCardPayload class]]) {
                    text = ((VYNFCNDEFTextXVCardPayload *)parsedPayload).text;
                } else if ([parsedPayload isKindOfClass:[VYNFCNDEFSmartPosterPayload class]]) {
                    VYNFCNDEFSmartPosterPayload *sp = parsedPayload;
                    for (VYNFCNDEFTextPayload *textPayload in sp.payloadTexts) {
                        text = [NSString stringWithFormat:@"%@%@\n", text, textPayload.text];
                    }
                    text = [NSString stringWithFormat:@"%@%@", text, sp.payloadURI.URIString];
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

See example. The objective-c version is available. The swift version will be added later.

## How to contribute

* Star this project.
* Send me pull requests which are welcome. If you make some changes in VYNFCKit.xcodeproj, don't forget to update and run (command+U in Xcode) the unit tests for both objective-c and swift. Please make sure examples also work well.
